🚀 Quick Start
1. Run Complete Analysis
python# Execute the main analysis
forecasts = run_comprehensive_analysis()

# View results
create_summary_dashboard(forecasts)
2. Individual Infrastructure Forecasting
python# Forecast specific infrastructure
model, forecast, historical = forecast_infrastructure_demand(
    historical_data, 
    'water_demand_liters', 
    years_ahead=5
)

# Visualize results
plot_forecast(model, forecast, historical, 'water_demand_liters')
3. Spatial Mapping
python# Create demand map
demand_map = create_demand_map(
    grid_data, 
    water_forecast, 
    'water_demand', 
    2029
)
